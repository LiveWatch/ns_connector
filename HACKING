Install your bundle:

	bundle install

Run guard:

	bundle exec guard

Or, run the tests manually:

	bundle exec rspec

* The restlet lives in support/restlet.rb
* There are basic conformance tests for it in support/
* You'll want a config in a file somewhere:

	$ cat tmp/ns_config 
	{
		:account_id => '1234',
		:email => 'email@site.com',
		:password => 'secret',
		:role => '5678',
		:restlet_url => 'https://rest.netsuite.com/app/site/hosting/restlet.nl?script=setme&deploy=setme'
		:valid_customer_id => 1234 # A test customer record for conformance tests
	}

* All of the development scripts and conformance tests are run the same way,
  something like:

	scripts/test_shell "$(cat tmp/ns_config)"
